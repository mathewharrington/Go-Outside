## Go Outside

Adapted from and extending a uni project. Solves no real world problem. Displays images of a given city in current weather conditions. 
More of a practice exercise than anything else.

## Go Outside Makes Use of:

* [Flickr API] (https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) 
* [OpenWeatherMap API] (http://www.openweathermap.org/api)
* [Laravel Framework] (https://laravel.com/)
* [Skeleton Responsive CSS Framework] (http://getskeleton.com/)

## Ideas For More Features:

* - [ ] Incorporate images from 500px also
* - [ ] AJAX - would only need landing page and send images without having to reload/redirect
* - [ ] More attractive grid - explore any CSS frameworks that play nicely with images - no sliders though!

## Use:

Feel free to add/remove/burn.
